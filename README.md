# üíé PixelProof3D ‚Äî Jewellery Security Protocol Scanner

**PixelProof** is an advanced AI-powered jewellery analysis system designed to **authenticate, inspect, and reconstruct** jewellery pieces with high precision.

It integrates the **[TripoSR](https://github.com/VAST-AI-Labs/TripoSR)** 3D reconstruction model to generate **high-quality 3D meshes and textures** from a single image, combined with our proprietary **Security Protocol Scanner** to assess **material authenticity, detect wear, and evaluate overall security grade**.

## üöÄ Features

- **Material Analysis** ‚Äî Identify surface type, reflectivity, and gloss level.
- **Spectral Analysis** ‚Äî Real-time color palette detection and harmony classification.
- **Damage & Wear Detection** ‚Äî Detect dents, scratches, and signs of wear.
- **Authenticity Scoring** ‚Äî Rates jewellery authenticity and security level.
- **3D Reconstruction** ‚Äî High-quality 3D OBJ & GLB models generated using TripoSR.
- **Evidence Capture Protocol** ‚Äî Securely capture and store images for verification.
- **Security Validation** ‚Äî Pass/Fail security scan with protocol status.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Upload** a jewellery image or **capture live** via a connected camera.
2. **PixelProof** runs **TripoSR** to create a 3D mesh and texture map.
3. **Security Protocol Scanner** evaluates:
   - Surface authenticity
   - Dents & scratches
   - Material reflectivity
   - Color harmony & saturation
4. **Generates a full Security Scan Report** with:
   - Authenticity level
   - Protocol status
   - Security score
